[![IPFS Design - a shared palette for coherent interfaces](screenshot.png)](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmcSKzW6SSS2ygfbXHJHtNnDtJd4pHvVHDQUwhiM5FuWkX/)

We use [tachyons] & [ipfs-css] to enable distributed creativity. By agreeing on
shared palette of colors, fonts, and scales, we can support independent groups
to experiment with new UI ideas which feel consistent, without requiring co-ordination.

## Usage

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br>
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br>
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br>
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br>
Your app is ready to be deployed!
